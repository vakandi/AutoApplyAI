# AutoApply AI for Linkedin and Indeed

## Introduction

This project is a web application that allows users to apply to jobs on Linkedin and Indeed using their resume and cover letter. The application uses Selenium to automate the process of applying to jobs on Linkedin and Indeed. The user can upload their resume and cover letter to the application and the application will use the information in the resume and cover letter to apply to jobs on Linkedin and Indeed. The user can also specify the job title, location, and keywords for the jobs they want to apply to. The application will then search for jobs on Linkedin and Indeed that match the user's criteria and apply to them.
